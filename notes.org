* nvcc compilation options
  1. -code : 
     a. specifies which *actual sm(streaming multiprocessor)*
     *architecture* the SASS code should be generated against and be
     included in the binary.
     + The valid format is -code=sm_XY.

     b. specifies which PTX code should be included in the binary
     for the forward compatibility.
     + The valid format is -code=compute_XY.

  2. -arch : specifies which *virtual compute architecture* the PTX code
    should be generated against. 
     + The valid format is, -arch=compute_XY.

  3. -gencode : combines both 1 and 2.
     + The valid format is -gencode=arch=compute_XY, code=sm_XY 
    
  4. option compatibility
     + -arch=compute_Xa is compatible with -code=sm_Xb when a <= b.
     + -arch=compute_X* is incompatible with -code=sm_Y* .
